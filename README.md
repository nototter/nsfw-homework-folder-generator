# nsfw-homework-folder-generator
want a homework folder of your own but dont want to go through 3099428329084 bit.ly links? congratulations you have a porn addiction

this uses code ripped from stackoverflow because im stupid (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18408307/how-to-extract-and-download-all-images-from-a-website-using-beautifulsoup)

this generates a random int, then puts it with a url from rule34notsayingtherestofit and then basically wgets every image and saves it in a folder

it is easy to write but my sanity says otherwise

NOTES:

used with python 3.9.10

blacklisting links in the script doesnt work

this will download mlp pron and furry pron so beware

this runs infinitely

you may get ip banned from rule34notsayingtherestofit if you do this for too long
-OR-
you do it to fast

the only way to bypass that is to use proxies which i will add later

good luck battling your porn addiction

(follow nototter on tiktok thanks)
